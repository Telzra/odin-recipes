    <div class="ingredients">
        <ul>
            <li>2 Beef steaks cut (about 600 g)</li>
            <li>Â½ cup Olive Oil</li>
            <li>4 Garlic</li>
            <li>4 Rosemary</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="instructions">
        <ol>
            <li>Firstly, place the beef in a suitable bowl and pour olive oil. You can use different cuts like ribeye, strip, tenderloin, and T-bone for preparing steak. Massage the beef with your hands for a few minutes until the olive oil covers all the parts of the meat.</li>
            <li>Grate the garlic cloves and add them with rosemary, salt, and black pepper to the oil. Mix the ingredients with the oil and massage the beef again.</li>
            <li>Cover the bowl with a plastic film and let it rest in the refrigerator to infuse it with the flavor. An essential point that makes the steak tastier is giving it enough time to marinate. To get a good taste and make it more tender when cooked, it should rest for at least 12 hours.</li>
            <li>Then remove beef slices from the marinade, and shake it to remove any excess liquid. Then brush BBQ grills or a heavy-based skillet with oil and heat it on high heat. It should get really hot, and you see wisps of smoke. The meat will be dried and tough if you grill the steaks with low heat for a long time.</li>
            <li>Once the oil is hot, place the steak on it and cook each side for; one minute if you like it rare, 2 minutes for medium rare, 3 minutes for medium, 4 minutes for medium well, and 5 minutes if you like it well cooked. Your beef steak is ready now. Serve it with mashed potatoes and caramelized onion, and enjoy.</li>
